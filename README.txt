== What is FEN? ==
Flexible Electrical Networks (FEN) Research Campus is an association of institutes of RWTH Aachen University and industrial partners.

The joint research of academia and industry under one roof at FEN Research Campus facilitates an efficient exchange of knowledge between the partners. In order to successfully cope with the challenges of our future energy supply, this transdisciplinary approach of pooling experience and disciplines is a necessary way to achieve innovation beyond the limits of a single competence.

FEN Research Campus is organized into three consortia associated with the main voltage levels (low, medium, high voltage) in the electrical utility grid. Each consortium is headed by a professor of RWTH Aachen University and is supported by a Chief Scientific Officer / Program Manager.

FEN organization house 
The High Voltage Consortium is organizationally located within FEN Research Campus; however, the research activities are realized by the Forschungsgemeinschaft für Elektrische Anlagen und Stromwirtschaft e.V. (FGH). FEN GmbH is the coordinator of FEN Research Campus.

The model of FEN Research Campus is based on the funding initiative “Forschungscampus – öffentlich-private Partnerschaft für Innovationen”. It is set up by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) to support the long-term collaboration between science and industry.


== What is the FlAixEnergy Project? ==
Within the project “FlAixEnergy“, FEN Research Campus contributes to the development and implementation of an energy flexibility platform. The platform merges decentralized producers and renewable energies to virtual power plants, while also connecting industrial consumers as flexibility clusters. The project aims for the derivation and standardization of an initial energy footprint.

FlAixEnergy focuses on the development of an innovative flexibility platform for synchronizing and trading the regional energy consumption of industrial consumers by means of decentralized energy production and distribution in the model region of Aachen.
The implementation of regenerative energy sources within industrial production, storage integration as well as smart energy services play an essential role in the context of energy transition. Based on these developments, the combination and coupling of different solutions is of particular importance in the framework of the research project.
